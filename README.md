The overall theme is **minimal** as _a clean computer offers clean thoughts_.

# Xcode

Xcode is an integrated development environment for macOS containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

You can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) or from [Apple's website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Most of the development tools rely on the Xcode command-line tools:

```bash
# use this to install them
xcode-select --install
```

# Homebrew

Homebrew calls itself "The missing package manager for macOS" and is oftentimes used to install different apps as you do on Linux (i.e apt install .../ pacman -S ... )

## Installation

> Make sure to have [Xcode command line tools](#xcode) installed first.

```bash
sudo xcode-select --install
```

Then use the following script to install Homebrew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

## Path

To make the Homebrew-installed packages available to your shell, you need to add your Homebrew location to your `$PATH`.

Use this command to add it to your bash profile (zsh, fish, or other shell guides are available on google)

```bash
echo 'PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Then to make sure it works, run

```bash
brew doctor
```

That's it!

Install apps using

```bash
brew install <formula>
```

Update formulaes with

```bash
brew update
```

> Note: If that command fails you can manually download the directory of formulas like this:

```bash
cd /usr/local/Homebrew/
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

To see a list of outdated apps use:

```bash
brew outdated
```

Homebrew keeps older versions of formulas installed on your system, in case you want to roll back to an older version. That is rarely necessary, so you can do some cleanup to get rid of those old versions:

```bash
brew cleanup
```

If you want to see what formulae Homebrew would delete without actually deleting them, you can run:

```bash
brew cleanup --dry-run
```

To see what you have installed (with their version numbers):

```bash
brew list --versions
```

To search for formulas you run:

```bash
brew search <formula>
```

To get more information about a formula you run:

```bash
brew info <formula>
```

To uninstall a formula you can run:

```bash
brew uninstall <formula>
```

## Casks

Homebrew-Cask extends Homebrew and allows you to install large binary files via a command-line tool. You can for example install applications like Google Chrome, Dropbox, VLC, and Spectacle. No more downloading .dmg files and dragging them to your Applications folder!

### Search

Search to see if your desired app is available as a Cask using:

```bash
brew search <package>
```

Here is an example:

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

# Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a lightweight but powerful text editor, capable of handling many programming languages like a full-fledged IDE.

## Installation

Install using brew:

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

## Launching from the command line

It's super useful to navigate to a folder and just write

```bash
code .
```

to open a new workspace on that folder.

This is done by adding code to `$PATH`.

1. Launch VS Code
2. Open the Command Pallete(Cmd+Shift+P) and type **`shell** command` to find _Install 'code' command in PATH_

## Keybindings

This is an essential step in becoming a better and faster coder. Here are the most useful ones:

- Ctrl+P / Command + P : Displays the search bar to search for files
  [ctrl+p.mp4](VS%20Code%20Ma%20af359/ctrlp.mp4)
- Ctrl + B / Command + B : Toggle the sidebar
- Ctrl + F / Command + F : Find words in code
- Ctrl + J / Command + J : Shows terminal
- Ctrl + Shift + M / Command + Shift + M : Quickly shows errors and warnings
- Ctrl + Shift + L / Command + Shift + L : Multi cursor selection
- Ctrl + D / Command + D : One by one selection
- Ctrl + / or Command + / : Comments current line
- Ctrl + Shift + I / Shift + Option + F : Formats the entire file
- Alt + Up or Down / Option + Up or Down : Move line Up or Down
- Ctrl + Space / Control + Space: Show Code Suggestions
- Ctrl + G / Command + G : Go to a specific line
- Ctrl + L / Command + L : Select current line
  For more keybindings check the official documentation, those ðŸ‘†, were the most useful ones.
